The 1st S-130PT Schema Sub-Group(SSG) was held in Monca from 4 to 5 July 2022. 
The group reviewed the PS initial description and reference S-1XX application schema. 
SSG1 identified the requirement for the application schema as follows for initial concept.

  - Maximum Display Scale / Minimum Display Scale
  - Spatial: Point/Curve/Polygon/NoGeometry
  - Numerical ID: MRN or URI
  - Source(optional)
