#### Title

The product specification for Polygonal demarcations of global sea areas

*Description: The title of the product specification.*

#### Abstract

This document describes an S-100 compliant product specification for Polygonal demarcations of global sea areas (PDGSA). The purpose is to support the provision of digital coordinates for limits of oceans and seas to meet requirements of contemporary geographic information systems. The S-130 datasets must designate global geographic sea areas by a system of unique numerical identifiers only.

Comment:Based on the S-130 ToRs and Proposal items 1.9.1-1.9.3 of A-2.

#### Product Specification Scope

1.Spatial Extent：
This product specification applies to the maritime area, described below: The area of applicability is the global maritime areas. 
East Bounding Longitude: 180° 
West Bounding Longitude: -180° 
North Bounding Latitude: 90° 
South Bounding Latitude: -90° 

2.Content: 
This product specification is a digital form of S-23 “Limits of the Oceans and Seas”, but it stipulates that global geographic sea areas must be designated by a system of unique numerical identifiers only. It specifies the content, structure, and metadata needed for creating the S-130 dataset and for its portrayal within an S-100 system. This product specification includes the content model, the encoding, the feature catalogue, portrayal catalogue, metadata, and implementation guidance for developers.
...

*Description: The overall scope of the Specification*

*Comments: This should include the expected SOURCE(s) of the data. For example: NIPWG publications...a source would be the Coast Pilot/Sailing Directions for S-126 (that way if someone thinks Tide Tables should be here
instead of with S-104 it will be listed).*

#### Justification

The 3rd Edition of S-23 “Limits of the Oceans and Seas” is not suitable for use in a digital environment. A transformation into a digital dataset named “Polygonal demarcations of global sea areas” would facilitate the joint standardization and service activities of IHO and other adjacent domains to support the e-Navigation concept of the IMO. So it is necessary to make S-23 content fit for digital dissemination through the transformation of information contained in a database of attributed area feature objects with global coverage.

#### Budget

No IHO budget is needed.
...

*Description: Statement of budget need and the figure*

*Comments: Is IHO budget needed? Will the development be financed by an
external party and to what extent? There should be general guidelines for how to calculate this...with reasonable values based on reality and evidence.*

Comment:Based on the S-130 product specification developments and timeline approved by S-130PT2.


...

*Description: Description of the intended time frame*

*Comments: Or at least the steps to accomplish since this is very difficult to determine.*
